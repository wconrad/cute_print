# cute_print

Write debug output to the console, with flair.  Features:

* Inspects its output, like Kernel#p.
* Writes to $stderr by default (good when $stdout is redirected).
* Can print the filename and line number.
* Can print the source of the value.
* Can print a value in the middle of a call chain.
* Configurable output device.

This is for those who prefer to debug by writing things to the
console.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "cute_print"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cute_print

## Usage

Start with:

    require "cute_print"

You can use q just like you use Kernel#p.  It will work the same,
except that its output goes to $stderr instead of $stdout:

    q "abc"            # "abc"
    q [1, 2, 3 + 4]    # [1, 2, 7]

You can have the debug source printed along with the value:

    i = 1
    q {i + 2}         # i + 2 is 3

Kernel#ql will add the source position:

    ql "abc"        # foo.rb:12: "abc"
    ql {1 + 2}      # foo.rb:13: 1 + 2 is 3

Call chains can be a pain to debug, but it's easy with Kernel#tapq and
Kernel#tapql:

    ["1", "2"].map(&:to_i).tapq.inject(&:+)
    # [1, 2]

    ["1", "2"].map(&:to_i).tapql.inject(&:+)
    # prints: bar.rb:12: [1, 2]

## Other gems with similar functions

The [_wrong_][1] gem includes the excellent #d method, which is very
much like this gem's #q method.  This gem's ability to read the debug
statement's source is derived from the _wrong_ gem.

Differences between the _wrong_ gem and this gem:

* The _wrong_ gem supports color output
* The _wrong_ gem writes only to stdout
* The _wrong_ gem supports Ruby 1.8
